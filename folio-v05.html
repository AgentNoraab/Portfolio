    but JavaScript seemed problematic, so was abandoned.
    If the user zooms, the header fixing is gone! -->
<!-- 26/6/21 Nev "fixed" header is very temperamental on Android mobile - Chrome v91.0.4472.101
    it was broken by this 40 character email with the normal font:
    Xxxxx.Xxxxxxxxxxxxx@education.nsw.gov.au
    Also broken by long web links - avoided with a short "display text" or small font.
    Max recommended image size is 940 pixels. 950 does not break the fixed header, but is almost off the screen.
    If fixed header is broken - delete sections 1 by 1 to find the problem -->

  </p>
  <p class="body-calibri"> This inspirational quote was designed hastily on Photoshop as a quick joke. The image utelises layers and frames in order to have the outer brick wall surrounding the quote. Without Photoshop, this layering would not become transparent and would block the image from being visable. <br>
